RideNow - A scalable ride-sharing backend system inspired by Uber, built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Redis. Implements real-time ride matching, geolocation tracking, and microservice-ready architecture. Designed for high performance, extensibility, and real-world system design practice.


#  RideNow - Uber Backend Clone

RideNow is a scalable ride-sharing backend system inspired by Uberâ€™s real-world architecture. This project is designed to simulate core functionalities like user management, real-time ride requests, driver-rider matching, and location tracking. It's an ideal system design portfolio project for aspiring backend engineers and FAANG candidates.
